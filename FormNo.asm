;we took each number separatly so we need to form our number and store in one bit for example if our number 235
FormNo:     pop ax  
            push dx      
            mul bx
            pop dx
            add dx,ax
            mov ax,bx       
            mov bx,10
            push dx
            mul bx
            pop dx
            mov bx,ax
            dec cx
            cmp cx,0
            jne FormNo
            ret
